    "- Keep track of all commands you use during your installation either by writing them down or creating a copy of your “history”.\n",
    "- To copy history issue the following: “history >> history.log”\n",
    "- Always use “sudo” before issuing a singularity command\n",
    "- If you are building your container on the platform, always use “screen”\n",
    "- You may need to install it in your instance “yum install screen”\n",
    "- Use the screen command before starting any work. This will keep your environment setup and commands running in case you lose your connection to the instance.\n",
    "- You can reattach your “screen” by issuing the “screen -r” command after getting disconnected.\n",
    "- You can manually detach your screen by using “ctrl+a+d” again “screen -r” will reattach it to your current session. \n",
    "- It’s better to build using a “centos” os vs ubuntu for your container.\n"
